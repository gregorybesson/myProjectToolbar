{"name":"MyprojectToolbar","tagline":"A Project Toolbar for your customers !","body":"# myProjectToolbar\r\n - A Project Toolbar for your customers : They can comment and screenshot a page they test and a Jira ticket will be automagically created !\r\n- A bookmarklet if you don't want or can't modify your code !\r\n\r\nTested succesfully on IE10+, FF, Chrome and Safari\r\n\r\n## Toolbar Usage\r\nThis project adds a toolbar at the bottom of a website. When the user click on \"open a bug\", an input box is open. The user can then enter the detail of his bug.\r\nThen, a screenshot is taken and a php script is called via ajax which creates a ticket in your Jira project. In this ticket, the following informations are entered :\r\n- The summary is what the user has entered\r\n- A screenshot is attached to the ticket. BEWARE - Sometimes, This is not possible to take a screenshot (see below). \r\n- The detail is filled in with\r\n   - the URL of the page \r\n   - the user-agent detail (including the browser and its version used to test)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the toolbar on your sites you just have to add a js on your project :\r\n\r\n     <script>var toolbarCode = \"SANDBOX\";</script>\r\n     <script src=\"http://myToolbar.domain/toolbar/toolbar.js\"></script>\r\n\t\r\nThe var toolbarCode is the JIRA project code for which you want to create a ticket.\r\n\r\nLimitations : This project uses html2canvas.js library (http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) which uses a canvas to create an image from the html page. As this is not 100% accurate, your screenshot is only a representation of what the user sees. Furthermore, sometimes, html2canvas is not able to take a screenshot. In this case, we open a ticket without the screenshot.\r\n\r\nAnother version could be based on a phantomJS screenshot but the result will not respect what the user sees neither...\r\n\r\n## Bookmarklet\r\nThanks to the bookmarklet, you can create a Jira ticket directly with a screenshot + url + user-agent + description of the bug by the user (see above for more details).\r\n\r\nThis bookmarklet calls a remote js which calls a \"Jira proxy\" so that you don't have to expose or ask for the user permissions. See below the code you have to put on a page so that you can propose your users to create a bookmark easily in one click (remember to change your domain) :\r\n\r\n     javascript: (function () { var jsCode = document.createElement('script'); jsCode.setAttribute('src', 'http://yourhost.domain/toolbar/toolbarlet.js'); document.body.appendChild(jsCode);   }());\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO List \r\n- Create a Chrome plugin so that the users can screenshot high fidelity screens and comment them.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
